## Overview

You can use this set of guidelines, [fork them](#) or make your own - the
key here is that you pick a style and stick to it. To suggest changes
or fix bugs please open an [issue](#) or [pull request](#) on Git Hub.

## General

### Avoid the use of

* CamelCase—it is difficult to scan quickly
* Descriptive prefixes or Hungarian notation such as `sp_` or `tbl`
* Plurals—use the more natural collective term instead
* Quoted identifiers—if you must use them then stick to SQL92 double quotes for
  portability

```sql
SELECT first_name
  FROM staff;
```

## Syntax

### Reserved words

Always use uppercase for the [reserved keywords](#keyword-reference) like
`SELECT` and `WHERE`.

It is best to avoid the abbreviated keywords and use the full length ones where
available (prefer `ABSOLUTE` to `ABS`).

Do not use database server specific keywords where an ANSI SQL keyword already
exists performing the same function. This helps to make code more portable.

```sql
SELECT model_num
  FROM phones AS p
 WHERE p.release_date > '2014-09-30';
```

### Indentation

Use four (4) spaces all the way through all the time. This makes the most sense
where there is a sub query.

```sql
-- TODO: need an example
```

### White space

To make the code easier to read it is important that the correct compliment of
spaces is used. Do not crowd code or remove natural spaces.

Always include spaces (this is not an exhaustive list):

* before and after equals (`=`)
* after commas (`,`)
* surrounding apostrophes (`'`) where not within parentheses or with a trailing
  comma or semicolon

Always include newlines/vertical space:

* after semicolons to separate queries for easier reading
* after each keyword definition
* after the comma of each column in the list
* before `AND` or `OR`

Keeping all the keywords aligned to the righthand side and the values left aligned
creates a uniform gap down the middle of query. It makes it much easier to scan
the query definition over quickly too.

```sql
-- No
SELECT a.release_date,a.title
FROM albums AS a
WHERE a.title='Charcoal Lane'OR
      a.title='The New Danger';


-- Yes
SELECT a.release_date,
       a.title
  FROM albums AS a
 WHERE a.title = 'Charcoal Lane'
    OR a.title = 'The New Danger';
```

## Naming conventions

### General

* Ensure the name is unique and does not exist as a
  [reserved keyword](#keyword-reference)
* Keep the length to a maximum of 30 bytes—in practice this is 30 characters
  unless you are using multibyte charset
* Names must begin with a letter and may not end with an underscore
* Only use letters, numbers and underscores in names
* Avoid the use of multiple consecutive underscores—these can be hard to read
* Use underscores where you would naturally include a space in name (first name
  becomes `first_name`)
* Avoid abbreviations and if you have to use them make sure they are commonly
  understood

```sql
SELECT first_name
  FROM staff;
```

### Tables

* Use a collective name or, less ideally, a plural form. For example (in order of
  preference) staff and employees.
* Do not prefix with `tbl` or any other such descriptive prefix or Hungarian
  notation
* Never give a table the same name as one of its columns
* Avoid, where possible, concatenating two table names together to create the name
  of a relationship table. Rather than `car_mechanic` prefer `service`

```sql
SELECT first_name
  FROM staff;
```

### Columns

* Always use the singular name
* Avoid simply using `id` as the primary identifier for the table
* Do not add a column with the same name as its table
* Always use lowercase except where it may make sense not to such as proper nouns

### Aliasing or correlations

* Should relate in some way to the object or expression they are aliasing
* As rule of thumb the correlation name should be the first letter of each word
  in the object's name
* If there is already a correlation with same name then append a number
* Always include the `AS` keyword—makes it easier to read as it is explicit
* For computed data (`SUM()` or `AVG()`) use the name you would give it were it
  a column defined in the schema

```sql
SELECT first_name AS fn
  FROM staff AS s1
  JOIN students AS s2
    ON s2.mentor_id = s1.staff_num;

SELECT SUM(s.monitor_tally) AS monitor_total
  FROM staff AS s;
```

### Stored procedures

* The name must contain a verb
* Do not prefix with `sp_` or any other such descriptive prefix or Hungarian
  notation

### Uniform postfixes

* `_id`—a unique identifier such as a column that is a primary key
* `_status`—flag value or some other status of any type such as
  `publication_status`
* `_total`—the total or sum of a collection of values
* `_name`—signifies a name such as `first_name`
* `_seq`—contains a contiguous sequence of values
* `_date`—denotes a column that contains the date of something
* `_tally`—a count
* `_size`—the size of something such as a file size or clothing
* `_addr`—an address for the record could be physical or intangible such as `ip_addr`
